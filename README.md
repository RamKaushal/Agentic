**Prompt**:
"Generate a realistic daily call volume dataset for a banking client (e.g., Citi) from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2025. The dataset should reflect:

Trends & Seasonality:

A gradual yearly increase in call volume (about 10% over two years).
Weekly patterns with higher volumes on weekends (Saturday & Sunday).
Holidays & Special Events:

Increased call volume on shopping-related holidays: Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve.
Decreased call volume on New Year's Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
Adjust call volumes on the days before and after major holidays to reflect customer behavior.
Billing Dates Impact:

Higher call volume on billing dates (7th, 25th, 26th, and 28th of each month).
Data Anomalies:

Introduce occasional missing days, null values, and random outliers to simulate real-world inconsistencies.
Include system outages or unexpected fluctuations as reasons for anomalies.
Output Format:

Columns: Date, Call Volume, U.S. Holiday Indicator, Call Volume Impact
Call Volume should be a numeric value reflecting the patterns above.
The U.S. Holiday Indicator column should specify the holiday name if applicable.
The Call Volume Impact column should explain volume fluctuations (e.g., 'Increased due to Black Friday' or 'Decreased due to New Year's Day')."*
