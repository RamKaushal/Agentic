2025-02-13 09:42:53,286 - INFO - Here's an insights report based on the provided data:

**1. Actual vs. Predicted Volume (November 11th - November 17th, 2024):**

*   **Underestimation:** The model consistently underestimated the call volume, especially on the weekend days (November 16th and 17th) where the actual call volume was significantly higher than predicted.
*   **Consistent Underestimation:** The model consistently underestimated the call volume for the entire period.

**2. 28-Day Forecast (December 2nd - December 29th, 2024):**

*   **Repeating Pattern:** The forecast shows a repeating pattern of call volume, with a lower volume predicted for the beginning of the week (Monday and Tuesday) and a higher volume predicted for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
*   **Increasing Volume Towards the End of December:** There's a noticeable increase in predicted call volume towards the end of December, starting around December 23rd. This could be due to seasonality or other factors.
*   **Potential for Overfitting:** The repeating pattern suggests the model might be overfitting to the training data, especially if the training data also exhibits a similar weekly pattern.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** All forecast predictions share the same timestamp, indicating they were generated at the same time.

**3. Last 100 Days of Actuals (August 17th - November 24th, 2024):**

*   **Weekend Spike:** Call volume tends to be higher on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) compared to weekdays.
*   **Consistent Weekday Volume:** Call volume appears relatively consistent on weekdays.
*   **No Holiday Impact:** The data doesn't show any significant impact of U.S. holidays on call volume within this period.
*   **Data Features:** The dataset includes various features like "Day of Week," "Day of Month," "Day of Year," "Week of Year," "Month," "Quarter," and "Is Weekend," which are likely used in the model to predict call volume.

**4. Overall Insights and Recommendations:**

*   **Model Accuracy:** The model needs improvement, as it consistently underestimates call volume.
*   **Weekend Effect:** The model should be trained to better capture the weekend spike in call volume.
*   **Seasonality:** The model seems to be capturing some seasonality, but it's important to validate if the increase in volume towards the end of December is accurate.
*   **Data Quality:** Ensure the training data is representative of future call patterns.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Consider adding more relevant features to the model, such as:
    *   External factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, promotions, news events)
    *   Historical trends (e.g., moving averages)
*   **Model Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error) and consider retraining the model with updated data.
*   **Model Selection:** Experiment with different time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, or more advanced machine learning models) to find the best fit for the data.
*   **Investigate the cause of the underestimation:** Analyze the training data to understand why the model is underestimating the call volume. Are there any specific events or trends that the model is not capturing?

In summary, the model shows potential but needs refinement to accurately predict call volume, especially on weekends and during periods of increasing volume. Regular monitoring, data quality checks, and model improvements are crucial for better performance.
