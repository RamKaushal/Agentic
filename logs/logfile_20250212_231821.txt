## Call Volume Analysis Report

**1. Data Overview**

*   **Actuals vs. Predicted (Past Week):** This dataset provides a comparison of the predicted call volume against the actual call volume for the past week (November 11th - November 17th, 2024).
*   **Forecast (Next 28 Days):** This dataset contains the predicted call volume for the next 28 days (December 2nd - December 29th, 2024).
*   **Historical Training Data (Last 100 Days):** This dataset provides the actual call volume for the last 100 days, including day of the week, weekend indicator, and other potentially relevant features.

**2. Weekday Call Distribution Analysis**

To analyze the call distribution across weekdays, I will aggregate the call volume data by day of the week for the training data, actuals, and forecast data.

**2.1. Training Data (Last 100 Days)**

| Day of Week | Average Call Volume |
| :---------- | :------------------ |
| 0 (Sunday)  | 570.0               |
| 1 (Monday)  | 547.0               |
| 2 (Tuesday) | 547.0               |
| 3 (Wednesday)| 547.0               |
| 4 (Thursday) | 547.0               |
| 5 (Friday)  | 653.0               |
| 6 (Saturday) | 653.0               |

**2.2. Actuals (Past Week)**

| Day of Week | Predicted Call Volume | Actual Call Volume |
| :---------- | :-------------------- | :----------------- |
| 0 (Sunday)  | 425.37                | 547.0              |
| 1 (Monday)  | 407.82                | 547.0              |
| 2 (Tuesday) | 420.63                | 547.0              |
| 3 (Wednesday)| 417.70                | 547.0              |
| 4 (Thursday) | 419.11                | 547.0              |
| 5 (Friday)  | 418.61                | 656.0              |
| 6 (Saturday) | 418.93                | 656.0              |

**2.3. Forecast (Next 28 Days)**

| Day of Week | Predicted Call Volume |
| :---------- | :-------------------- |
| 0 (Sunday)  | 441.89 - 465.66       |
| 1 (Monday)  | 415.72 - 448.44       |
| 2 (Tuesday) | 418.90 - 451.62       |
| 3 (Wednesday)| 420.49 - 462.98       |
| 4 (Thursday) | 429.57 - 458.21       |
| 5 (Friday)  | 429.75 - 450.78       |
| 6 (Saturday) | 430.91 - 454.66       |

**2.4. Weekday Trend Analysis and Deviations**

*   **Training Data:** The training data shows a clear pattern: call volumes are consistently higher on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) compared to weekdays.
*   **Actuals (Past Week):** The actuals from the past week align with the training data pattern, with higher call volumes on Friday and Saturday. However, the predicted values are significantly lower than the actuals, especially on the weekends.
*   **Forecast (Next 28 Days):** The forecast data maintains the weekend pattern, with slightly higher call volumes on weekends. The forecast values are relatively consistent across the weekdays, with a slight increase towards the end of December.

**3. Anomaly Detection**

I will identify days with significantly higher or lower call volumes than usual, excluding U.S. holidays and the two days following each holiday. Since no holidays are specified, I will use the average call volume from the training data as a baseline.

**3.1. Anomaly Detection Methodology**

1.  **Calculate the average call volume** for each day of the week from the training data.
2.  **Calculate the standard deviation** of the call volume for each day of the week from the training data.
3.  **Define a threshold** for anomaly detection (e.g., 2 standard deviations from the mean).
4.  **Compare** the actual call volumes from the past week to the baseline and identify any days that exceed the threshold.

**3.2. Anomaly Report (Past Week)**

Based on the training data, the average call volume for each day of the week is:

*   Sunday: 570
*   Monday: 547
*   Tuesday: 547
*   Wednesday: 547
*   Thursday: 547
*   Friday: 653
*   Saturday: 653

The standard deviation for each day of the week is not provided, so I will use the overall standard deviation of the training data for this analysis.

*   **Friday, November 15, 2024:** Actual call volume: 656.0. Deviation from the average Friday call volume (653.0): +3.0. This is not a significant deviation.
*   **Saturday, November 16, 2024:** Actual call volume: 656.0. Deviation from the average Saturday call volume (653.0): +3.0. This is not a significant deviation.

**4. Email to Operations Team**

Subject: Inquiry Regarding Call Volume Anomalies

Dear Operations Team,

This email is to inquire about potential issues that may have impacted call volume on the following dates:

*   **Friday, November 15, 2024:** Actual call volume was 656.0, which is slightly higher than the average Friday call volume of 653.0.
*   **Saturday, November 16, 2024:** Actual call volume was 656.0, which is slightly higher than the average Saturday call volume of 653.0.

Could you please investigate if there were any events, system issues, or other factors that might have contributed to these call volume levels? Any insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Data Scientist

**5. Key Insights and Recommendations**

*   **Seasonality:** The data exhibits clear weekend seasonality, with higher call volumes on Fridays and Saturdays. This pattern should be considered when forecasting and resource allocation.
*   **Prediction Accuracy:** The predicted call volumes for the past week were consistently lower than the actual call volumes, especially on weekends. This indicates a potential issue with the forecasting model.
*   **Model Improvement:** The forecasting model should be reviewed and potentially retrained to better capture the weekend seasonality and improve accuracy. Consider incorporating additional features, such as day of the week, weekend indicator, and potentially external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, product launches).
*   **Holiday Impact:** While no holidays were specified, the model should be tested for holiday impact.
*   **Trend Analysis:** The forecast data shows a slight increase in call volume towards the end of December. This could be due to seasonal factors (e.g., end-of-year promotions, increased customer activity).
*   **Actionable Recommendations:**
    *   **Review and Retrain the Forecasting Model:** Address the underestimation of call volumes, especially on weekends.
    *   **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Ensure adequate staffing levels, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays.
    *   **Monitor Forecast Accuracy:** Continuously monitor the accuracy of the forecasting model and make adjustments as needed.
    *   **Investigate the End-of-Year Trend:** Analyze the factors driving the potential increase in call volume towards the end of December and prepare accordingly.
    *   **Investigate the cause of the higher call volume on the weekends.**

**6. Report Summary for Management**

*   **Key Finding:** The call volume exhibits a strong weekend seasonality, with higher volumes on Fridays and Saturdays. The current forecasting model underestimates call volumes, particularly on weekends.
*   **Anomaly:** The call volumes on Friday, November 15, 2024, and Saturday, November 16, 2024, were slightly higher than the average.
*   **Recommendations:**
    *   Improve the forecasting model to better capture weekend seasonality.
    *   Optimize staffing levels based on the predicted call volume, especially on weekends.
    *   Monitor forecast accuracy and make adjustments as needed.
    *   Investigate the factors driving the potential increase in call volume towards the end of December.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Review the forecasting model and identify areas for improvement.
    *   Collaborate with the operations team to investigate the causes of the call volume anomalies.
    *   Implement the recommended actions to improve forecast accuracy and optimize resource allocation.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the provided data, highlighting key insights, anomalies, and actionable recommendations. The findings should be used to inform data-driven decision-making and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the call center operations.
