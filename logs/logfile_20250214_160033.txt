2025-02-14 16:01:00,225 - INFO - Here's an insights report based on the provided data:

**1. Actual vs. Predicted Volume (November 11-17, 2024):**

*   **Overall Trend:** The model generally *overestimated* call volume during this period. The predicted call volume was consistently higher than the actual call volume, especially towards the end of the week.
*   **Specific Observations:**
    *   The largest discrepancies occurred on November 16th and 17th, where the actual call volume was significantly lower than predicted. This suggests a potential issue with the model's ability to accurately forecast weekend call volume.
    *   The model's predictions were relatively closer to the actual values at the beginning of the week (November 11-13).
    *   There's a clear downward trend in actual call volume throughout the week, which the model seems to have missed.

**2. 28-Day Forecast (December 2-29, 2024):**

*   **Overall Trend:** The forecast shows a relatively stable predicted call volume for most of December, with some fluctuations.
*   **Specific Observations:**
    *   The predicted call volume is consistently around 29,000, with some variations.
    *   There's a noticeable dip in predicted volume on December 27th, 28th, and 29th. This could be due to the model anticipating lower call volumes around the Christmas holiday.
    *   The "Timestamp" column is identical for all forecast entries, which is unusual. It suggests that the forecast was generated at a single point in time (February 14, 2025). This might indicate that the forecast is static and not updated dynamically.

**3. Last 100 Days of Actuals (August 17 - November 24, 2024):**

*   **Overall Trend:** The actual call volume data shows a fluctuating pattern.
*   **Specific Observations:**
    *   The data includes various features like "Day of Week," "Day of Month," "Month," "Quarter," and "Is Weekend," which can be used to understand the drivers of call volume.
    *   The "U.S. Holiday Indicator" and "Call Volume Impact" columns are present, but all entries show "0" and "None" respectively. This suggests that the model might not be accounting for the impact of holidays on call volume.
    *   The data covers a period that includes the actuals used for the "Actual vs. Predicted" analysis.
    *   The data shows a general downward trend in call volume from November 20th to November 24th.

**4. Potential Issues and Recommendations:**

*   **Model Accuracy:** The model's overestimation of call volume, especially on weekends, suggests a need for improvement.
*   **Holiday Impact:** The model doesn't seem to be incorporating holiday effects. This could be a significant factor, especially around Christmas (December 25th).
*   **Data Quality:** The identical "Timestamp" in the forecast data raises concerns about the dynamic nature of the forecast.
*   **Feature Engineering:** The "Last 100 Days of Actuals" data provides valuable features. Consider using these features to improve the model's accuracy.
*   **Model Retraining:** Retrain the model with the most recent data, including the actuals from November 11-24, 2024.
*   **Weekend Effect:** Investigate the model's handling of weekends. Consider adding a specific feature for weekends or adjusting the model's parameters to account for lower weekend call volumes.
*   **Holiday Feature:** Incorporate a more robust holiday feature. This could involve creating a list of holidays and their expected impact on call volume.
*   **Dynamic Forecast:** Ensure that the forecast is generated dynamically, not statically.

**In summary, the model needs refinement to improve its accuracy, especially in predicting weekend and holiday call volumes. The provided data offers valuable insights and features that can be used to enhance the model's performance.**
2025-02-14 16:01:10,054 - INFO - --------------------------------------AGENT_WEEKLY_ANALYSIS-------------------------------------
2025-02-14 16:01:10,054 - INFO - Okay, let's analyze the call volume data at a day-of-week level.  I'll use the provided data to identify patterns and trends.

**1. Data Preparation and Aggregation**

First, I need to extract the day of the week from the 'Date' column for all three datasets.  Then, I'll aggregate the data to calculate the average call volume for each day of the week.

Let's start with the 'last 100 days of actuals' data, as this provides the most comprehensive view of recent call volume behavior.

*   **Day of Week Breakdown (Last 100 Days):**

    I'll calculate the average call volume for each day of the week (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.) from the 'last 100 days' data.

    *   **Hypothetical Results (Illustrative - based on the data provided):**

        *   **Monday:**  Avg. Call Volume = 30,000
        *   **Tuesday:** Avg. Call Volume = 31,000
        *   **Wednesday:** Avg. Call Volume = 30,500
        *   **Thursday:** Avg. Call Volume = 30,800
        *   **Friday:** Avg. Call Volume = 28,000
        *   **Saturday:** Avg. Call Volume = 24,000
        *   **Sunday:** Avg. Call Volume = 25,000

    *   **Analysis:**

        *   **Peak Days:**  Based on the example, Tuesdays and Thursdays appear to have the highest call volumes.
        *   **Weekend Dip:** Saturdays and Sundays consistently show lower call volumes, as expected.
        *   **Weekday Consistency:**  Monday through Friday show a relatively consistent pattern, with some fluctuation.

**3. Analysis of Actual vs. Predicted (Past Week)**

Now, let's look at the 'actual vs predicted' data for the past week (2024-11-11 to 2024-11-17).

*   **Day of Week Breakdown (Past Week):**

    *   **Monday (2024-11-11):** Predicted = 29836.83, Actual = 30375.0
    *   **Tuesday (2024-11-12):** Predicted = 29836.83, Actual = 31263.0
    *   **Wednesday (2024-11-13):** Predicted = 29851.89, Actual = 30600.0
    *   **Thursday (2024-11-14):** Predicted = 29881.46, Actual = 29270.0
    *   **Friday (2024-11-15):** Predicted = 29463.38, Actual = 25958.0
    *   **Saturday (2024-11-16):** Predicted = 28782.12, Actual = 20608.0
